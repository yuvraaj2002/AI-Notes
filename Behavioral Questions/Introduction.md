Good afternoon, sir. First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself. I am Yuvraj Singh, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Chandigarh University. Talking about my technical experience, in my 3-year journey at university, I have explored various domainsâ€”from doing internships at reputed organizations, to working on freelance projects for a US-based firm, to writing two research articles and becoming a Microsoft Student Ambassador. 

Now, I would like to be more precise by mentioning what I did and the impact I created. Recently, I completed my 6-month internship at Samsung Research and Development under the profile of AI Researcher, where I worked on building a pipeline for personal document identification and masking from images. I am happy to share that out of all 300 interns working on the same problem statement, I received an Excellence Award from Samsung for creating the most robust solution. 

Additionally, in my third year, I did another internship at a Gujarat-based startup called Wictronix, where I built software for lane detection, number plate recognition, and helmet recognition. The software we created is currently successfully implemented at XYZ Chowk, and based on information from the CTO of the startup, the Gujarat traffic police have collected fines totaling over Rs 27,000 from rash drivers. At Wictronix, I was also given the responsibility of mentoring 8 interns and received recognition as the Best Employee of the Month.

Furthermore, in the same year, during January and February, I completed a freelance project for a US-based firm in the healthcare industry. I was given a dataset of 1.6 lakh images and tasked with building a model to classify one of 32 skin diseases and provide the confidence score. I delivered that project two weeks ahead of my deadline with an accuracy of 98.4%.
