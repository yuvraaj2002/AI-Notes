This page is dedicated towards understanding everything related to Z test in hypothesis testing and the main resources used for this topic are the course videos of CampusX.

In case of Z test we actually deal with the Z distribution that is standard normal distribution so to get the detailed understanding about this distribution move to this 

##### What do you mean by Z test and where do we use it ?

Z test is a hypothesis test which is used in couple of scenarios such as to determine whether there exist a significant difference between sample mean and hypothesized mean or whether there exist a significant difference between the means of 2 groups, given population standard deviation is known

##### What are the conditions which must be satisfied before using Z test ? 

1. The size of sample is large nâ‰¥30
2. The population standard deviation is known
3. Sample is taken from normally distributed population

##### What is the formula for calculating the Z statistic value

##### Steps that are being followed 

1. Setup null and alternative hypothesis
2. Calculate the z statistic value
3. Calculate the p value using the distribution
4. Compare the p value with LOS and accept or reject null hypothesis
