- [[Git]] : For versioning code.
- [[DVC]] : For data and model versioning.
- [[MLflow]] : For experiment tracking and model versioning.
- [[Docker]] : For environment versioning.
- [[Kubeflow Pipelines]] : For pipeline versioning.

In summary, while Git and GitHub are fundamental for code versioning in MLOps, comprehensive versioning in MLOps extends to data, models, pipelines, and environments, often requiring additional specialized tools.
