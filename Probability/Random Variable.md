- What do you mean by expected value ?
    
    Expected value simply means the average value of random variable over large number of trials of experiment.
    
    <aside> üí° Finding the expected value theoretically means find the average value of the population data

    ### Example
    
    Let us simply assume that we are conducing a random experiment of throwing a die and noting down the number which came, now in case we want to find what would be the average value of dice if we conducted the trial of throwing 1 million times, in that case we have 2 options ‚¨áÔ∏è
    
    1. Conducing the trial 1 millions times and noting down value and finding the average (acquiring Population data)
    2. Using concept of expected value for discrete random variable to find the average value.
    
    E(X) = 1_1/6 + 2_1/6 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 6*1/6 = 3.5

- What do you mean by expected variance
    
    Expected variance simply means the variance of random variable over large number of trials of random experiment.
