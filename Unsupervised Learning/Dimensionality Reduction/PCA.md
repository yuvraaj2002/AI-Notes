This page is dedicated towards understanding the concept of PCA algorithm in machine learning and all the resources that I will be using for understanding be linked below

Before actually moving on to understanding that how this algorithm works we need to be aware about the fact that why we even need this algorithm at the first place and for that we need to be aware about the problem which we face with high dimensional data called, "Curse of dimensionality"

### What do you mean by Curse of dimensionality and what are the ways to deal with it ? 


### What do you mean by PCA and give short summary of how it works
