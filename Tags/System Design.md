This page is actually dedicated towards understanding everything related to system design and the main repository which I have used for this topic is mentioned below along with some other resources I have and will be using along the way

- [System Design GitHub](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources)
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#database)

Now the thing is that in the system design interview the best way we can handle the questions is that if we are aware about the key concepts, building blocks and general pattern to approach them so down below we will be talking about each of these things.
