This page is dedicated towards understanding the concept of GRU in neural network and the resources used for understanding this topic will be linked below.

### [What do you mean by GRU and tell why it got introduced if we already had the LSTM ?](#)

### [What is the foundational difference between LSTM and GRU ?](#)

### [What are the various gates present in the GRU and their functionality ?](#)

### [Why does the candidate hidden state calculated in the update gate is not added in the hidden state directly ?](#)
