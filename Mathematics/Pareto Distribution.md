##### What is pareto distribution and why we use this ? 

Pareto distribution is basically continuous probability distribution which got introduced to model the quantities that show the power law distribution, where power law distribution describes the relationship between 2 variables, where one variable is proportional to power of other variable.

$$ y=k⋅x^α $$

##### Which parameter affects the shape of pareto distribution and talk about its affect on shape ? 

![[Pareto_function.png]]

In the pareto distribution there is only 1 parameter which is alpha and with the change in the value of alpha the shape of the distribution also gets affected, where 

- With high value of alpha : The skewness of the distribution increases and the the tail becomes light-weight
- With small value of alpha: The skewness decreases and the distribution spreads out, with which the tail become heavy

##### Give examples where we see and use pareto distribution ? 

- Pareto distribution originally got introduced to provide the relationship between the wealth acquisition and the individuals. It showed that most of wealth is acquired by small number of individuals and small amount of wealth is distributed towards large amount of general population.
- Population density and the area often follow pareto distribution where certain small cities will have high population density.

##### What are the ways using which we can detect pareto distribution ? 

- **Using log log plot**: Find the log of both the variables and plot the graph between them and if graph is showing a relationship where increase in one value results in decrease in other value then it shows pareto distribution
- **Using q-q plot**
