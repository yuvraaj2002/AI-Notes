This page is actually dedicated towards understanding the concept of Log Normal distribution and the resources used for this topic will be mentioned below

##### What do you mean by log normal distribution and how it is related to normal distribution ? 

Log normal distribution is basically a continuous probability distribution whose log basically gives us normal distribution and talking about how it looks visually it seems to be very much skewed on the right side with long tail.

##### What is the Probability density function of log normal ?

Since this is a continuous probability distribution function so its PDF will be called Probability density function and it is given as

##### What are the parameters associated with the Log normal and how does the shape gets affected ?

 - Change in mean → Change the position towards left or right but the shape of distribution will remain same
- Change in standard deviation → Change the shape of distribution as increasing standard deviation would make the distribution more spread out and reducing the standard deviation would make the distribution more concentrated around the mean.

##### What is the mean and variance of log normal distribution ? 


##### Where do we use log normal distribution in data science in general
