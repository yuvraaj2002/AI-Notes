This page is actually dedicated towards the indexing of all the topics that I know so for and all the topics that I would love to explore in the future and this indexing will actually help me to identify and pin point what things I don't know and will help me to prevent going over the things I already know. In this indexing the things will be related to Machine learning, General Topics, Deep learning, Mathematics, SQL , Database , Python and other things which I will be adding
