Yes, you are correct! In this code snippet, [selenium](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#1%2C6-1%2C6) is a package, [webdriver](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#1%2C22-1%2C22) is a module within the [selenium](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#1%2C6-1%2C6) package, and [Chrome](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#3%2C32-3%2C32) is a class within the [webdriver](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#1%2C22-1%2C22) module. By calling `webdriver.Chrome()`, you are instantiating an object of the [Chrome](file:///d%3A/Selenium/Home.py#3%2C32-3%2C32) class to control the Chrome web browser.

- Point to note is that the browser do not give access to any automation tool to perform action instead it our code first interact with the browser driver and then that broswer driver interpret the code and execute them in browser
