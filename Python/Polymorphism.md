This page is dedicated towards understanding the concept of polymorphism in object oriented programming and the resources used will be indexed below.

##### What is polymorphism in object-oriented programming?

Polymorphism is one of the feature of object oriented programming which states that functions or operators with the same name can be executed on different objects.
